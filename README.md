## 🔎 What is Inquiro?

Inquiro is a web-based Question & Answer platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to simulate a simple social learning system.
It allows users to ask questions, browse topics, explore question details, and manage their profile in a clean and intuitive interface.

This project showcases front-end development fundamentals—file structuring, UI design, form handling, interactivity, and page-to-page navigation.

With Inquiro, you can:

Ask Questions

A dedicated Ask a Question page allows users to submit their questions with a well-structured form and clean UI.

Browse Topics

A Topics page helps users explore questions categorized under different subjects—making navigation smooth and organized.

View Question Details

Each question opens on a Question Details page where users can see the full content and additional info.

Manage User Profile

A visually structured Profile page displays user information, stats, and activity.

Clean UI + Responsive Structure

Designed with clear layout, readable typography, and consistent styling.

*(List major functionalities you have implemented — e.g. user authentication, question / answer UI, profile pages, etc.)*
